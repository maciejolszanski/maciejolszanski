## Hi there 👋

I am a begginer Python programmer. I am happy to see you on my GitHub. Please take a look at my profile.

### My projects
Currently, I spend most of my time developing my Data Science skills. Here are my repos within this area:

* [Machine Learning](https://github.com/maciejolszanski/ML_basics)
* [Data Visualisation](https://github.com/maciejolszanski/Data_visualisation)
* [Data Mastering](https://github.com/maciejolszanski/Data_mastering)
* [Flight Price checker](https://github.com/maciejolszanski/Flight_price_checker)

I made few web projects using Django, too:
* [Budget Manager](https://github.com/maciejolszanski/Budget_manager)
* [Learning Logs](https://github.com/maciejolszanski/Learning_Logs)

You can also find here few projects using pygame module  - developing them I improved OOP.
* [Icy Tower](https://github.com/maciejolszanski/Icy_Tower)
* [Alien Invasion](https://github.com/maciejolszanski/Alien_Invasion_development)

And smaller web-scraping projects:
* [EDO rates](https://github.com/maciejolszanski/EDO_rates) - developed as a python module
* [Perfumes prices](https://github.com/maciejolszanski/Web_scraping_perfumes_prices)
